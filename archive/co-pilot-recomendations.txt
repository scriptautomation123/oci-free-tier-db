Principal Engineer Response:

Excellent point. You want schema-level lifecycle management, not infrastructure recreation. This is a common pattern in Oracle environments. Here's the idiomatic approach:

Recommended Architecture for Schema Management
1. Separate Infrastructure from Application Lifecycle
Infrastructure (Terraform):

Provision database once (or reuse existing)
Keep database running (Always Free tier = no cost)
Application (Ansible):

Schema drop/create/reset operations
Package deployment
Data loading
Testing
2. GitHub Actions Workflow Structure


# deploy-oracle-packages.yml (NEW)
name: Deploy Oracle Packages

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      action:
        description: 'Deployment action'
        required: true
        default: 'deploy'
        type: choice
        options:
        - deploy              # Deploy packages to existing schema
        - reset-schema        # Drop & recreate schema, then deploy
        - reset-data          # Keep schema, reset data only
        - test-only          # Run tests against existing deployment

jobs:
  ansible-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Setup Ansible
        # Install Ansible, configure OCI credentials
      
      - name: Run Ansible Playbook
        run: |
          ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/local-complete.yml \
            --extra-vars "deployment_action=${{ inputs.action }}"


3. Enhanced Ansible Playbook Structure
# local-complete.yml (ENHANCED)
- name: Database Schema Management
  when: deployment_action in ['reset-schema', 'reset-data']
  block:
    - name: Drop schema (if reset-schema)
      # SQL: DROP USER schema_name CASCADE;
    
    - name: Create fresh schema 
      # SQL: CREATE USER schema_name IDENTIFIED BY password;

- name: Deploy Packages
  when: deployment_action in ['deploy', 'reset-schema', 'reset-data']
  # Install Oracle packages

- name: Load Data
  when: deployment_action in ['reset-data', 'reset-schema'] or load_test_data
  # Load test data

- name: Run Tests
  when: deployment_action != 'skip-tests'
  # Validation tests


4. Database Connection Pattern
Best Practice: Use existing database with multiple schemas/users:
-- Infrastructure: Single database (permanent)
-- Application: Multiple schemas (ephemeral)

-- Schema lifecycle:
DROP USER partition_test CASCADE;  -- Clean slate
CREATE USER partition_test IDENTIFIED BY "password";
GRANT CONNECT, RESOURCE TO partition_test;
-- Deploy packages to partition_test schema

Terraform State Management
# main.tf
resource "oci_database_autonomous_database" "main_db" {
  # This stays provisioned
  lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true  # Never destroy the database
  }
}

# No schema resources in Terraform
# Schemas managed by Ansible/SQL script

6. Workflow Options
Infrastructure Workflow (run once):

provision-infrastructure.yml
Creates database, keeps running
Application Workflow (run frequently):

deploy-oracle-packages.yml
Schema reset, package deploy, test
Uses existing database
Local Development:

local-complete.yml
Same Ansible tasks, runs locally
7. Cost Optimization
Database: Provision once, reuse indefinitely (Always Free = $0)
Schemas: Create/destroy as needed (no additional cost)
Data: Generate test data on-demand
8. Workflow Selection Logic


# Common scenarios:
# 1. New feature development:
GitHub Actions → "Deploy Oracle Packages" → "reset-schema"

# 2. Bug fix testing:
GitHub Actions → "Deploy Oracle Packages" → "deploy"

# 3. Data testing:
GitHub Actions → "Deploy Oracle Packages" → "reset-data"

# 4. Local development:
terraform apply (once)
ansible-playbook local-complete.yml --extra-vars "deployment_action=reset-schema"

**Principal Engineer Response:**

Yes, exactly! Two workflows is the idiomatic, best-practice approach:

## Workflow Architecture

### 1. **Infrastructure Workflow** (Run Once/Rarely)
- **File**: provision-infrastructure.yml (keep existing)
- **Purpose**: Provision Always Free Oracle database
- **Frequency**: Once per environment, or when infrastructure changes
- **Triggers**: Manual, Terraform file changes
- **Outputs**: Database connection details, Terraform state

### 2. **Application Workflow** (Run Frequently) 
- **File**: `deploy-oracle-packages.yml` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Schema management, package deployment, testing
- **Frequency**: Every feature, bug fix, data refresh
- **Triggers**: Manual with action selection, code changes to SQL/packages
- **Inputs**: Deployment action (deploy/reset-schema/reset-data/test-only)

## Separation Benefits

| Aspect | Infrastructure Workflow | Application Workflow |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Runtime** | 10-15 minutes | 2-5 minutes |
| **Approval** | Production environment gate | Optional/configurable |
| **Cost Risk** | High (infrastructure changes) | Zero (schema-only) |
| **Frequency** | Rare | Frequent |
| **Dependencies** | None | Requires existing database |

## Typical Usage Patterns

```bash
# Initial setup (once):
1. Run "Provision OCI Infrastructure" → Creates database

# Daily development (frequent):
2. Run "Deploy Oracle Packages" → Action: "reset-schema" 
3. Run "Deploy Oracle Packages" → Action: "deploy"
4. Run "Deploy Oracle Packages" → Action: "test-only"
```

This follows **single responsibility principle** and Oracle DBA best practices where infrastructure and application lifecycles are managed separately.

Should I create the `deploy-oracle-packages.yml` workflow now?
