# GitHub Actions Migration - Implementation Summary

## üìã Overview

This document summarizes the migration of infrastructure provisioning to GitHub Actions, following industry best practices.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

**Date Completed:** 2025-10-13  
**Implementation Approach:** Direct Terraform Execution in GitHub Actions

## üéØ Key Decision: Direct Terraform vs Ansible Orchestration

### Decision Made: Direct Terraform Execution in GitHub Actions

**Rationale:**

1. **Industry Standard**: HashiCorp provides official `setup-terraform` GitHub Action - this is the most common pattern in modern DevOps
2. **Better CI/CD Integration**: Native support, cleaner logs, easier debugging
3. **Simpler Pipeline**: Fewer dependencies, faster execution, less complexity
4. **State Management**: Works seamlessly with remote backends
5. **Cost & Maintenance**: One less tool to maintain in CI/CD environment

**Where Ansible Still Adds Value:**
- Local development workflows
- Interactive deployments requiring human approval
- Complex multi-tool orchestration
- Custom validation workflows

### Comparison Matrix

| Aspect | Direct Terraform (GitHub Actions) | Ansible + Terraform |
|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| CI/CD Integration | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Native | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Good |
| Simplicity | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Simple | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê More complex |
| Debugging | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Easy | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Moderate |

| Multi-tool Orchestration | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Good | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Excellent |
| Industry Standard | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Yes | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Niche |

   - Configurable reviewers and wait timers

3. **Always Free Tier Validation**
   - Automated validation before any Terraform operations
   - Checks all critical Always Free tier settings
   - Fails fast if configuration violates free tier limits

4. **Concurrency Control**
   - Prevents concurrent Terraform executions
   - Uses `concurrency` group based on branch

## üöÄ Workflow Capabilities

### 1. Automatic Validation (No Manual Trigger Required)

**Triggers:**
- Pull requests to main branch
- Push to main branch
- Changes in `terraform/**` or workflow file

**Actions:**
- Validates Always Free tier configuration
- Runs `terraform fmt -check`
- Runs `terraform init`
- Runs `terraform validate`
- Runs `terraform plan`
- Comments plan summary on PR (for PRs)
- Stores plan as artifact

**Does NOT:**
- Apply any infrastructure changes
- Require manual approval

### 2. Manual Deployment (Apply)

**Trigger:**
- Manual workflow dispatch with action: `apply`
- Or automatic after push to main (with approval)

**Actions:**
- All validation steps
- Downloads saved plan or creates new one
- **Applies infrastructure changes**
- Uploads outputs as artifacts
- Creates deployment summary

**Requires:**
- Manual approval via `production` environment

### 3. Manual Destruction (Destroy)

**Trigger:**
- Manual workflow dispatch with action: `destroy`

**Actions:**
- Runs `terraform destroy`
- **Permanently deletes all infrastructure**

**Requires:**
- Manual approval via `destroy` environment
- Recommended: Multiple reviewers

## üìä Workflow Jobs

1. **validate-free-tier**
   - Validates Always Free tier configuration in tfvars
   - Fails if configuration violates free tier limits
   - No dependencies

2. **terraform-plan**
   - Depends on: validate-free-tier
   - Runs Terraform plan
   - Comments on PR (if applicable)
   - Uploads plan artifact
   - Permissions: contents:read, pull-requests:write

3. **terraform-apply**
   - Depends on: terraform-plan
   - Only runs on: workflow_dispatch with action=apply OR push to main
   - Requires environment: production
   - Applies infrastructure changes
   - Uploads outputs
   - Permissions: contents:read, id-token:write

4. **terraform-destroy**
   - No dependencies
   - Only runs on: workflow_dispatch with action=destroy
   - Requires environment: destroy
   - Destroys all infrastructure
   - Permissions: contents:read

## üí∞ Cost Protection

All deployments use Always Free tier configuration:

- ‚úÖ `is_free_tier = true`
- ‚úÖ `cpu_core_count = 1`
- ‚úÖ `storage_size_tbs = 0.02` (20GB)
- ‚úÖ `auto_scaling_enabled = false`
- ‚úÖ `acknowledge_free_tier_limits = true`

**Estimated Cost: $0.00/month (Always Free tier)**

## üîÑ Migration Path

For teams currently using Ansible for infrastructure provisioning:

1. **Phase 1**: Review GitHub Actions workflow and documentation
2. **Phase 2**: Set up GitHub Secrets and Environments
3. **Phase 3**: Test workflow with `plan` action
4. **Phase 4**: Deploy to test environment with `apply` action
5. **Phase 5**: Gradually transition to GitHub Actions for production deployments
6. **Ansible**: Keep for local development and complex orchestration

**Note**: Both approaches can coexist. Teams can use GitHub Actions for CI/CD while developers use Ansible locally.

## üéì Learning Resources

- **GitHub Actions Official Docs**: https://docs.github.com/en/actions
- **HashiCorp Terraform GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform
- **GitHub Environments**: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments
- **OCI Provider Docs**: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oracle/oci/latest/docs

## ü§ù Maintenance

### Updating the Workflow

1. Make changes in a feature branch
2. Test in your fork or with `act` (https://github.com/nektos/act)
3. Open PR for review
4. Update documentation if behavior changes
5. Test in non-production environment first

### Monitoring

- Review workflow runs in Actions tab
- Check for failed runs and investigate
- Monitor OCI costs (should always be $0.00)
- Keep Actions and Terraform versions up to date

## üìû Support
